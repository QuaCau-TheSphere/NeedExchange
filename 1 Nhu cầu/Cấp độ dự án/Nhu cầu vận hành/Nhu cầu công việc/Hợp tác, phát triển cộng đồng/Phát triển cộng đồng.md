## **Key functions of an ecosystem of collaborative software tools:**

Here are a number of areas that we have decided are critical to this collaborative ecosystem.

- **Notifications Dashboard:** aggregated notifications of activity that is sourced from activity from tools in the ecosystem
- **Chat and Direct Messaging:** one-to-one and one-to-many messaging, with tunable privacy as appropriate to communication goals
- **Representation of Group Membership and Group Auth:** a tool that stores who is a member of which group, who can see the data that the group contains, and can invoke single-purpose tools through “group authentication”
- **Representation of which groups are using which tools:** this enables the community to understand which tools are part of the set of tools in use in a given environment
- **Intent-casting + Collaborative discovery:** discovery of aligned intentions + matching of available requests and offers. Can include bounties/price tags in a variety of currencies.
- **Collaborative ideation & brainstorming:** allows decentralized groups to ideate and brainstorm together
- **Collaborative decision making:** allows decentralized groups to come to decisions together
- **Collaborative budgeting:** allows decentralized groups to allocate common-pool resources
- **Network visualization:** allows users to interact with different types of visual representations of shared data and membership
- **Reputation**: allows users to assess the past actions of network participants based on user tunable, context aware preferences
- **Identity**: allows users to be aware of the identity of other users over time tied to reputation
- **Mutual Credit:** allows users to create and track mutual credit exchanges
- **Task management:** allows users to assign and track completion of tasks
- **Dues collection:** allows users to pool resources
- **Common Resource Pool Management:** allows users to pool resources that can be invested collectively
- **Crowdfunding:** allows users to gather small contributions from large numbers of people
- **Cryptoequity:** allows users to share equity in each other’s projects and work with outside financing
- **Smart Contracts:** allows users to create contracts with each other that are machine-executable
- **Personal data management and export tools:** allow users to manage access to and export their private data
